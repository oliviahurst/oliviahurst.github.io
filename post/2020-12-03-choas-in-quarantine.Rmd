*Here's a fun blog post about how COVID-19 basically ruined everything, but somehow we still got something out of it by learning how to code in python (sort of). In the simplest of terms, "COVID sucks". Online classes are hard enough as it is without a national pandemic yet somehow, we mastered up enough strength to finish out the semester, and for some of us, our college career. We can use a reticulate not only to tie together the fact that COVID does indeed suck, but also to show how R and Python communicate to share information.*

## Reticulate

*First, we add in the chunck of code from R.*

```{R}
library(reticulate)
COVID <- "Please give me an A;"
```

*Next, we add the Python chunk and access the R defined obejct using r to tie the two together.*

```{python}
sucks = "this is my last assignment before I graduate."
print(r.COVID, sucks)
```

*The Python defined object can also be accessed in R using py$.*

```{R}
cat(c(COVID,py$sucks))
```

## But Really Though...

*This time has been difficult for everyone, and every person has experienced loss in some way during this season. Thank you for*
