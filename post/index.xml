      <description>Here&#39;s a fun blog post about how COVID-19 basically ruined everything, but somehow we still got something out of it by learning how to code in python (sort of). In the simplest of terms, &amp;quot;COVID sucks&amp;quot;. Online classes are hard enough as it is without a national pandemic yet somehow, we mastered up enough strength to finish out the semester, and for some of us, our college career. We can use a reticulate not only to tie together the fact that COVID does indeed suck, but also to show how R and Python communicate to share information.</description>
